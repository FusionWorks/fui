# fui
Simple CSS framework

## Install depandencies

`npm install `

## Compile and watch scss files

`npm run scss `


### Observations
- Compiled css can be found on `/css/index.css`

- A playground html file can be found on `/demo/index.html`

- `scss` script watches the index.scss file from scss folder, so all scss file need to be included in `/scss/index.scss`
